## JNLP

Application is available using Java web start technology via [androidscreencast.jnlp](http://xsavikx.github.io/AndroidScreencast/jnlp/androidscreencast.jnlp).

### Java security configuration

Due to Java security restriction policy, that was updated in java 7 and
is restricted even more in java 8, we're now not able to run JNLP without some security "hacks".

To use JNLP, please follow this article: [How can I configure the Exception Site List?](https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/exception_sitelist.xml)
